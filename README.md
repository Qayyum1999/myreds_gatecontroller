# MyREDS Gate Controller
An app for improving house residency area. The app serves a purpose to allow residents in residency area to have the ability to control the residency's entrance and exit gates.

This is an app I made for my internship program for 3 months at AR Mechatronics PLT. 

## How does it work?

The app have 2 navigation page.
1. Home Page
2. Detail Page

## Home Page
User can view lists of residency area locations and location ID's.
